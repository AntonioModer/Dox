# Dox
A Lua Documentation Generator Script

##How To Comment Your Code
This section coming soon...
For now, that info is available in the 'index.html' file found in the 'docs' folder.

##Example Usage
Dox is very easy to use. Once you've commented your code appropriately, all you need are your scripts and an empty directory where Dox can output the html files.

dox.processDir(sPathToMyLuaFiles, sPathToTheOutPutDirecotry);

That's it! Tada, you've got documentation!
